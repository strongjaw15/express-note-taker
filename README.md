## Description

This full-stack web app is deployed on heroku and allows the user to write, store, and retrieve simple notes. I wanted to build a site that used a back end server to save my notes instead of local storage. This way the notes are there regardless of where I access the site from. While working on this project I learned about express and REST, using get and post routes.
